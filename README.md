Reference : [Tensorflow-Project-Template](https://github.com/MrGemy95/Tensorflow-Project-Template).

Add MNIST example, use `tf.data` to handle data.

Step by step:

1. In `data_loader` folder create a python script to process your raw data.

2. Before build your model, you need create a `json` file in `configs` folder to specify some property.

3. In `models` folder create a file to construct your Deep Learning model.

4. Build a trainer to train your model in `trainers` folder.

5. In `mains` folder create a file to instantiate some objects you need and run your model.
